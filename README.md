# Why?
Ablue allowed me to leak so and after like 2 months i decided to drop JAR with a implemented locker so if i decide (or the devs) to make the jar unusable then yk.

# How To Use
1. Download the Fabric installer from here, open it and choose Minecraft 1.20.4 & Fabric Loader 0.15.6
2. Download org_apache-5.2.1.jar (Francium) from this repository page along with [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/version/0.96.1+1.20.4) and put them into your .minecraft/mods folder
3. Start the game (with Fabric)
